## ## Task 5: Capture and Analyze Network Traffic Using Wireshark
## Objective
Capture live network packets and identify basic protocols and traffic types using Wireshark.

## Tools Used
Wireshark (packet capture and analysis)

Firefox browser (to generate HTTP traffic)

Ping utility (to generate ICMP traffic)

## Methodology
Started a live packet capture on the active network interface.

Generated network traffic by:

Opening Firefox and browsing a website to create HTTP traffic.

Pinging google.com to generate ICMP packets.

Performing DNS lookups to generate DNS traffic.

Stopped the capture after approximately one minute.

Applied display filters in Wireshark to isolate specific protocols.
Identified and analyzed at least three different protocols (TCP, HTTP, DNS).

Saved the capture as task5_traffic_analysis.pcapng.
